      <description>Public Lab: 3rd &amp;amp; 4th Week  Having a robust initial codebase is all that matters. Integration will be frictionless, and you can be sure of a much more stable environment, right from the beginning.
 The third and forth week was an interesting time slice. What made it so, was the fact that the codebase now had a sturdy foundation, so in a way the hard part was over.</description>

      <description>Public Lab: 1st &amp;amp; 2nd Week  From refactoring an 7-year-old library, to embedding node support into it, while optimizing it for browser, the first two weeks started off as one of the most interesting but crucial stages of my timeline, and yet somehow, we made it work.
 I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wrong to say that this period of Google Summer of Code at Public Lab was indeed, in my case, rather epiphanic.</description>
